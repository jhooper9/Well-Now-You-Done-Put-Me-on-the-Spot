Tips and steps for deploying community into your org.
The package xml file should be updated to reflect the necessary components for the community. This should allow you to pull all the aspects of the community with no errors.

***BEFORE DEPLOYING TO YOUR ORG***
You have to make sure that you change the current username to your username,
otherwise you will get an error. Let's avoid that by following these steps in 
VS code. 
1. First, Right click on the /force-app/main/default folder and pick the 'Find in Folder'
option.
2. Search for all instances of my email 'dameniq12'. 
3. Replace my email with your own that you use in your org. There are two types of versions you should encounter. One for the specific org to use and a sender email for emails salesforce sends you for org implementation. Make sure you edit each properly. 
4. Save the modified file.
5. Now you can deploy the code into your org.
